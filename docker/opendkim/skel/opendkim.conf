# Socket smtp://localhost

# ##  Socket socketspec
# ##
# ##  Names the socket where this filter should listen for milter connections
# ##  from the MTA.  Required.  Should be in one of these forms:
# ##
# ##  inet:port@address           to listen on a specific interface
# ##  inet:port                   to listen on all interfaces
# ##  local:/path/to/socket       to listen on a UNIX domain socket
#
#Socket                  inet:8892@localhost

##  PidFile filename
###      default (none)
###
###  Name of the file where the filter should write its pid before beginning
###  normal operations.

PidFile               /var/run/opendkim/opendkim.pid


# Always oversign From (sign using actual From and a null From to prevent
# malicious signatures header fields (From and/or others) between the signer
# and the verifier.  From is oversigned by default in the Debian pacakge
# because it is often the identity key used by reputation systems and thus
# somewhat security sensitive.

##  ResolverConfiguration filename
##      default (none)
##
##  Specifies a configuration file to be passed to the Unbound library that
##  performs DNS queries applying the DNSSEC protocol.  See the Unbound
##  documentation at http://unbound.net for the expected content of this file.
##  The results of using this and the TrustAnchorFile setting at the same
##  time are undefined.
##  In Debian, /etc/unbound/unbound.conf is shipped as part of the Suggested
##  unbound package

# ResolverConfiguration     /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

##  TrustAnchorFile filename
##      default (none)
##
## Specifies a file from which trust anchor data should be read when doing
## DNS queries and applying the DNSSEC protocol.  See the Unbound documentation
## at http://unbound.net for the expected format of this file.

TrustAnchorFile       /usr/share/dns/root.key

##  Userid userid
###      default (none)
###
###  Change to user "userid" before starting normal operation?  May include
###  a group ID as well, separated from the userid by a colon.
#
UserID                opendkim

##  KeyTable dataset
##      default (none)
##
##  Defines a table that will be queried to convert key names to
##  sets of data of the form (signing domain, signing selector, private key).
##  The private key can either contain a PEM-formatted private key,
##  a base64-encoded DER format private key, or a path to a file containing
##  one of those.

KeyTable              __KEYTABLE__

##  SigningTable dataset
##      default (none)
##
##  Defines a dataset that will be queried for the message sender's address
##  to determine which private key(s) (if any) should be used to sign the
##  message.  The sender is determined from the value of the sender
##  header fields as described with SenderHeaders above.  The key for this
##  lookup should be an address or address pattern that matches senders;
##  see the opendkim.conf(5) man page for more information.  The value
##  of the lookup should return the name of a key found in the KeyTable
##  that should be used to sign the message.  If MultipleSignatures
##  is set, all possible lookup keys will be attempted which may result
##  in multiple signatures being applied.
